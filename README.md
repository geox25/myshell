# myshell
A simple and minimalist UNIX shell in very early development.

## Information
- As seen in the ``CMakeLists.txt``'s, C++17 should be used.
- I usually compile the files using CLion, so depending on your IDE/environment
make sure that ``main.cpp`` is compiled to the top project directory and that ``psrc/help.cpp`` is compiled to ``pbin``.
